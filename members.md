### Bio

Eat, sleep, crypto. Like many others on the EOS Nation team, Yves is passionate about crypto and the future that EOS will bring. Yves has been focusing on EOS full-time since early January 2018. Yves began his journey into computers at a very young age, building his first computer at 6 years old. Yves has always had a deep ideological relationship with computers and their role in a decentralized future. Yves began his university studies in software engineering, but quickly realized the human aspect was where his heart resided. After completing studies in psychology and pure sciences, Yves bridged the gap by focusing on perceptual and computational neuropsychology. In his professional life, Yves brings his background to organizations looking to create autonomous efficiencies and effectivness to processes using technology. When Yves isn't in front of his computer, he is an avid reader, a lover of the outdoors - some of you may have crossed Yves on one of his many backountry expeditions - and a world traveller. Yves is fluent in Japanese having spent the early part of his formative adult years living in Japan.

### Bio

<p>Born, raised and living in Toronto.
Earned a Bachelor of Journalism from Ryerson University in 2009.

Woken out of slumber during an LSD trip in university, inspired to live a life dedicated to the values of Truth, Love, and Freedom. Like a lonely leaf on a branch suddenly discovering I’m attached to a beautiful tree.

Worked briefly as a chase producer for Global TV.

Been working in Financial Technology for the past 10 years in various capacities: customer service, sales, sales coaching, agent training, digital marketing, digital process management (LEAN green belt), and digital messaging product management (certified scrum master, certified product owner). At work I'm known for my customer focus, technology expertise, relationship building skills, and ability to bring those together to design great digital customer experiences.

I was briefly director of operations and marketing at a blockchain consulting firm, but I walked away because I wasn’t a fan of the private ledger direction they were heading in. (Ethereum wasn't able to satisfy any practical business use cases - that's when I started looking for opportunities in the EOS community).

In my free time, I like to learn about Austrian Economics, technology (especially blockchain), and the philosophy of ethics. I enjoy time with my thoughts in nature, as well as making genuine connections with my community. I'm by no means a developer, but I have some aptitude for coding. I coded my first website in the 7th grade on a hand-me-down Mac clone. I've since lost touch with my HTML skills, but have some pretty mean wordpress game. I've dabbled with SQL at work, and have recently started learning C++.

Like our friend Dan Larimer, I’d like to dedicate myself to creating free market solutions to secure life, liberty and property.

I recently started the [EOS Toronto meetup](http://meetup.com/eos-toronto/) and have been working with bluejays from EOS Go and some others to grow that community.</p>

### Bio

Passionate full-stack developer. Loves Go, taught Python for many years. 

Much of my last work involved data, building data products and infrastructures. Making it useful to people around. Worked with Python, pandas and friends, Go data science tools. I love building tools for fellow developers.

I love deploying Kubernetes and administering clusters and after studying all options, I used bootkube, terraform, EC2 and GCP last time I kickstarted new clusters.

I have fine eyes for details, both at macro and micro levels. I appreciate work well done.

I love automation. I automate anything I do for the third time. I can't live without continuous deployment, A/B testing and feature switches. I don't do what machines can do.
